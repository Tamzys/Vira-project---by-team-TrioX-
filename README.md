VIRA is a lightweight, offline multi-agent assistant built entirely in a Kaggle/Jupyter Notebook. It behaves like a personal concierge — remembering user details, answering questions, handling preferences, doing calculations, and responding naturally — all without using any external APIs or internet-based models.
